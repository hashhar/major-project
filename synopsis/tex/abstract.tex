\sectionLabel*{Abstract}

We are developing a deep reinforcement learning approach to control
musculoskeletal biomechanical models which do not need motion-capture data or
explicit programming to replicate a motion. We will develop a musculoskeletal
biomechanical human model using \emph{Stanford OpenSim} \cite{delp2007opensim}
trained to replicate motion like standing and walking without external controls
using reinforcement learning. All actuation forces are the result of 3D
simulated muscles and as a result our controllers will generate motion patterns that
incorporate biomechanical constraints like metabolic energy expenditure. The
generated controllers will be able to find different gaits based on target
speed, target direction and other external control factors.
