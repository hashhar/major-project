\subsectionLabel*{Problem Formulation}

In robotics with the help of reinforcement learning instead of expensive and
complex explicit programming robots can teach themselves how to move in virtual
spaces and real environments. For the project musculoskeletal models of human
body will be used. Thereafter the model will be trained for performing
activities such as standing still, walking-gait, jumping, etc. The models will
be built using \emph{Stanford OpenSim} --- biomechanical physics environment for
musculoskeletal simulations. For deep reinforcement learning, deep learning
frameworks such as \emph{TensorFlow} \cite{abadi2016tensorflow} will be used,
which can be combined with \emph{Keras-rl} \cite{plappert2016kerasrl} framework
which implements state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms in
Python.
